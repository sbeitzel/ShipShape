<p>ShipShape is a free app for accessing Appleâ€™s App Store Connect API.</p>

<p>ShipShape was initially created in a
<a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/plus/live-streams/shipshape">Hacking with Swift+ live stream</a>,
but the project is now open sourced so it can be developed further. Our ambition is to
produce an app that reads and writes all of the App Store Connect API, making a powerful
tool free for everyone.</p>

<p>Once ShipShape is stable, the plan is to merge it into another project called
<a href="https://github.com/twostraws/ControlRoom">Control Room</a>, which gives users control over
the iOS Simulator.</p>
